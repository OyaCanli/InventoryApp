# Inventory App
Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree Project 9: 

This was the final project of Android Basics Nanodegree. The aim was to create an inventory app using a ContentProvider.

The project rubric for this project was too specific, not leaving room for making a more creative inventory app. However, I still pushed the rubric to include three sql tables, and managed to try some new things:
- I used a single activity with multiple fragments, as advised in the last Google I/O. I added fragment transitions.
- I experimented with ConstraintSetAnimations and designed such an animation on the FAB button. 
- I used TapTargetPrompt library for onboarding the user with a few QuickStart prompts.
- I added the functionality for adding photo to products, either from camera or gallery.
- I used a DatePickerDialog which is a kind of DialogFragment.

Here is a short video demonstrating quick start and constraint set animations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb3mNeeyCcA
